      		<h1 id="Odds-Shifting-In-Favor-of-Vikings-After-Huge-Week-1-Victory"><a href="#Odds-Shifting-In-Favor-of-Vikings-After-Huge-Week-1-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Odds Shifting In Favor of Vikings After Huge Week 1 Victory"></a>Odds Shifting In Favor of Vikings After Huge Week 1 Victory</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings were surprise winners in Week 1 against the New Orleans Saints, and they have odds shifted in their favor as a result.</p>
<p>The Saints opened as 3-point favorites at home, but the Vikings won by 29 points and are now 2.5-point favorites on the road. The moneyline has also shifted in favor of the Vikings, moving from +105 (bet $100 to win $105) to +115.</p>
<p>The Vikings had one of the most impressive performances of any team in Week 1, and they now look like one of the best bets in the NFL. QB Kirk Cousins was efficient and threw for two touchdowns, while the defense shut down Drew Brees and the Saints’ high-powered offense.</p>
<p>The next test for the Vikings comes in Week 2 when they take on the Green Bay Packers. The Packers are coming off a disappointing loss to the Chicago Bears and will be looking to get back on track at home. This is a matchup of two NFC North rivals, and it should be an exciting game to watch.</p>
<p>The Packers are currently 3-point favorites at home, but this line could move closer to even depending on how both teams play in Week 1. The total for this game is 55 points, and it should be another high-scoring affair between these two teams.</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Vikings-a-Popular-Choice-with-Sportsbook-Bettors-After-Strong-Start"><a href="#Minnesota-Vikings-a-Popular-Choice-with-Sportsbook-Bettors-After-Strong-Start" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Vikings a Popular Choice with Sportsbook Bettors After Strong Start"></a>Minnesota Vikings a Popular Choice with Sportsbook Bettors After Strong Start</h1><p>It’s been a strong start to the season for the Minnesota Vikings, and that’s translating into some serious support from sportsbook bettors. At many online betting sites, the Vikings are one of the most popular bets to win the Super Bowl this year.</p>
<p>Minnesota is coming off a 13-3 season in which they reached the NFC Championship game. This year, they look even better with an explosive offense led by quarterback Kirk Cousins and a defense that has been significantly upgraded.</p>
<p>The Vikings have opened the season with a 2-0 record, including a win over the Green Bay Packers in Week 2. That victory was especially impressive, as it came on the road against a team that was expected to be one of the top contenders in the NFC this year.</p>
<p>Cousins has been tremendous so far this year, throwing for 647 yards and eight touchdowns. He’s also been efficient, completing 70 percent of his passes. The running game has also been solid, with Dalvin Cook rushing for 271 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Vikings defense has been good but not great so far this year. They’ve given up 311 yards per game, which is more than they allowed last year (283). However, they’ve forced six turnovers and held their opponents to just 16 points per game.</p>
<p>Minnesota is a 3-point favorite against the Buffalo Bills in Week 3. The Bills have had an up-and-down start to the season, but they still present a challenge for the Vikings. Buffalo has one of the best defensive lines in football, led by Star Lotulelei and Jerry Hughes. They’ve also got a couple of dangerous playmakers on offense in LeSean McCoy and Kelvin Benjamin.</p>
<p>The Vikings should be able to win this game, but it won’t be easy. If they can come away with a victory then they’ll definitely be considered one of the favorites to reach the Super Bowl this year.</p>
<h1 id="Vikings-Continue-to-be-a-Popular-Bet-with-Las-Vegas-Oddsmakers"><a href="#Vikings-Continue-to-be-a-Popular-Bet-with-Las-Vegas-Oddsmakers" class="headerlink" title="Vikings Continue to be a Popular Bet with Las Vegas Oddsmakers"></a>Vikings Continue to be a Popular Bet with Las Vegas Oddsmakers</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings continue to be a popular bet with Las Vegas oddsmakers. The team is currently favored to win the NFC North division and has odds of +450 to make it to the Super Bowl this season.</p>
<p>Despite making the playoffs last year, the Vikings had disappointing results, losing in the first round to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles. This year, they are looking to make a run and potentially bring a championship home to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Vikings return quarterback Kirk Cousins, who was signed as a free agent in the offseason. Cousins threw for over 4,000 yards and 27 touchdowns last year with Washington and will look to build on that this season. The Vikings also return running back Dalvin Cook, who looked promising before tearing his ACL last season.</p>
<p> defensively, the vikings lose some key players including linebackers Anthony Barr and Eric Kendricks, as well as safety Andrew Sendejo. However, they do bring in veteran linebacker Terrell Suggs from Baltimore, who should help fill some of the void left by Barr and Kendricks. The secondary also returns Xavier Rhodes and Harrison Smith, who are both considered among the best at their positions.</p>
<p>Overall, the Vikings look like they have a good chance of returning to the playoffs and possibly making a deep run this year. They currently have odds of +450 to win the Super Bowl, which puts them behind only a few teams in terms of betting odds. If you’re looking for a team with good value to bet on this year, the Vikings could be a good choice.</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-Fading-the-New-England-Patriots-andMoving-Towards-the-Minnesota-Vikings"><a href="#Bettors-Fading-the-New-England-Patriots-andMoving-Towards-the-Minnesota-Vikings" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Fading the New England Patriots andMoving Towards the Minnesota Vikings"></a>Bettors Fading the New England Patriots andMoving Towards the Minnesota Vikings</h1><p>As the NFL season approaches its midway point, the New England Patriots have been one of the most disappointing teams in the league. After starting the year with a 1-2 record, many bettors have begun to fade the defending Super Bowl champions and are moving their money towards the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>The Patriots have looked bad on both sides of the ball, with quarterback Tom Brady struggling to find his rhythm and the defense giving up big plays. Meanwhile, the Vikings have been one of the best teams in the league, thanks largely to their strong defense and MVP-caliber play from quarterback Kirk Cousins.</p>
<p>As a result, the Vikings are now considered one of the favorites to win Super Bowl LIII, while the Patriots are seen as longshots. This has caused many bettors to abandon ship on New England and invest in Minnesota instead.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the Patriots can turn things around and make a playoff run, or if they will continue to falter down the stretch. In any case, it looks like most people are now betting against them and favoring Minnesota instead.</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-NFL-Wagering-Work-A-Guide-for-Minnesota-Vikings-Fans"><a href="#How-Does-NFL-Wagering-Work-A-Guide-for-Minnesota-Vikings-Fans" class="headerlink" title="How Does NFL Wagering Work? A Guide for Minnesota Vikings Fans"></a>How Does NFL Wagering Work? A Guide for Minnesota Vikings Fans</h1><p>In the National Football League, there are 32 teams. Out of those 32 teams, 17 of them are in the American Football Conference (AFC) and 15 are in the National Football Conference (NFC). The AFC and NFC champions then play each other in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>To understand NFL wagering, you must first understand how the league is divided up. The NFL is divided into two conferences: the AFC and NFC. Each conference has 16 teams that play a total of 16 games each (two against each team in their conference, and one against each team in the other conference). </p>
<p>The winners of each division then play each other in the playoffs. The four division winners in each conference are joined by two wild card teams – the best two non-divisional winners. These six teams then compete in a three-round playoff structure to determine which team will represent their conference in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>At the end of the regular season, teams are ranked from first to last in their respective conferences based on their win-loss record. If two or more teams have identical records, rankings are determined by tiebreakers (see below). The top team from each conference is awarded a bye week during the playoffs; they automatically advance to the next round.</p>
<p>The AFC playoff bracket looks like this: 1) Bye Week; 2) Division Champion; 3) Wild Card Winner; 4) Division Champion; 5) Wild Card Winner; 6) Division Champion </p>
<p>The NFC playoff bracket looks like this: 1) Bye Week; 2) Division Champion; 3) Wild Card Winner; 4) Division Champion; 5) Division Champion; 6) Wild Card Winner </p>
<p>If a team from one conference defeats a team from another conference in the Super Bowl, that conference is declared the champion. For example, if the New England Patriots defeat the Atlanta Falcons in this year’s Super Bowl, the AFC would be declared champion even though New England is a member of the NFC. </p>
<p>Now that you understand how NFL divisions work, let’s take a look at how wagering works. Wagering on NFL games can be done through a variety of methods, including but not limited to: point spreads, money lines, game totals (over/under), and parlays. We will explore each type of wager in detail below. </p>
<p>Point Spreads: A point spread is a bet where oddsmakers give one team an advantage over another team. This “handicap” is typically expressed as a number of points that one team must either beat or lose by for bets on that side to pay out. For example, if Team A is playing Team B and Team A is favored by four points, that means they must win by more than four points for bets on them to payout. If they win by exactly four points, then all bets on Team A would be considered pushes (meaning no one wins or loses), and all money bet would be refunded back to players. Conversely, if Team B is favored by four points over Team A, then they must lose by less than four points for bets on them to payout – otherwise they would be considered losses just like any other underdog bet would be. </p>
<p>Money Lines: A money line bet gives you odds on who will win a game outright – no point spread involved. For example, if Team A is playing Team B and Team A has +120 odds while Team B has -140 odds, it means that for every $100 you bet on Team A to win outright, you would receive $120 back plus your initial $100 back – so your total return would be $220 ($120 profit plus your original stake of $100). If you were to bet on Team B instead, you would need to risk $140 in order to potentially make only $100 back (plus your original stake). So again, with money line betting you are essentially betting on who will win rather than whether or not one side will cover a point spread set by oddsmakers.. </p>
<p>Game Totals Over/Under: This type of wager simply asks whether or not you think both teams will score more or less than a certain number of points combined throughout the course of the game (called “the total”). For example, if Seattle Seahawks are playing San Francisco 49ers and Over/Under 43 points has been set by oddsmakers for this particular matchup, then those placing bets on this prop would either be betting that both teams will score more than 43 points together OR they would be betting that neither Seattle nor San Francisco will score more than 43 points combined throughout regulation time. As with every other wager type here – there’s always risk involved when putting your hard-earned cash down! </p>
<p>Parlays: As mentioned before, parlay betting allows you to combine multiple bets into one single wager – with increased potential</p>
