#  Closed Nassau Casino Could Be a Major Boon for Melia Hotel

The closure of the Nassau casino could turn out to be a major boon for the Melia hotel.

The Nassau casino, which closed in February, had been a major source of business for the Melia. With the casino gone, the Melia is looking for other ways to fill its rooms. And one way it’s doing that is by lowering its room rates.

In fact, the Melia is now offering some of its rooms for as little as $79 per night. That’s a significant discount from the $209 per night rate it was charging before the casino closed.

And it seems to be working. The Melia reports that it’s seen a jump in bookings since it lowered its rates. In March, occupancy at the hotel was up nearly 20%.

It’s not clear how long the Melia can keep this up or whether this is just a short-term strategy to make up for lost business from the casino closure. But even if it’s only a temporary fix, it’s still good news for the hotel and its guests.

#  Closed Nassau Casino To Start Generating Pedestrian Traffic for Melia Hotel

The Nassau casino is now closed, but that doesn't mean the Melia Hotel is without guests. Pedestrian traffic has increased on Cable Beach since the casino's closure and this is good news for the Melia Hotel.

The Nassau casino was a popular spot for tourists, however its closure will now shift attention to the Melia Hotel. With its prime location on Cable Beach, the hotel is in a great position to take advantage of the increased foot traffic.

Tourists who would have typically visited the casino are now looking for other places to spend their money and the Melia Hotel is in a good position to benefit from that. The hotel has already seen an increase in bookings and it's expected that this trend will continue in the coming months.

The closure of the Nassau casino is certainly something that has impacted the local tourism industry, but the Melia Hotel is well-positioned to take advantage of that. Thanks to its prime location and its recent renovations, the hotel is poised for success.

#  Closed Nassau Casino Next Door to The Melia Hotel in The Bahamas

The Nassau Casino, which is located next door to The Melia Hotel in The Bahamas, has announced that it will be closing its doors later this year. This news has come as a disappointment to many of the hotel’s guests, who were looking forward to being able to enjoy some gaming action during their stay.

The Nassau Casino is one of the largest gaming establishments in the area, and it has been a popular destination for tourists and locals alike for many years. However, the casino’s owners have made the decision to close it down in order to focus on other business interests.

This closure will leave The Melia Hotel without any form of gambling whatsoever, which may be a turnoff for some guests. However, the hotel is still offering an impressive range of amenities and services, including a spa, several restaurants, and plenty of lounging areas.

It is currently unclear what will happen to the Nassau Casino building once it closes its doors. Some reports suggest that it may be turned into a residential complex, while others claim that it could be used as a new hotel or even a shopping center. Only time will tell what comes of this iconic property.
