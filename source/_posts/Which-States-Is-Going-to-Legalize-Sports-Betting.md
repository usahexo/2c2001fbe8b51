#  Which States Is Going to Legalize Sports Betting?

The legalization of sports betting is a hot topic in the United States. With many states considering the issue, there is no clear answer on which state will be the first to legalize it.

There are a few states that are considered front runners to legalize sports betting first. These states include New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia. Each of these states has something unique to offer that could help them legalize sports betting first.

In New Jersey, there is already a law that allows for sports betting at casinos and racetracks. The state is currently fighting in court to overturn a federal ban that restricts sports betting to only four states. If New Jersey is successful, it could be the first state to legalize sports betting.

Delaware has also been working on legislation to allow for sports betting within its borders. The state has already legalized online gambling, so it would be a natural next step to legalize sports betting as well. This would give Delaware an edge over other states in terms of revenue from this type of gambling.

West Virginia is also considering legalizing sports betting. The state has not yet released any specific plans, but it is clear that they are interested in the idea. West Virginia could benefit from legalizing sports betting because it would bring in additional revenue for the state government.

Other states that are considering legalizing sports betting include Pennsylvania and Michigan. These states have not made as much progress as New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia, but they are still considered contenders for the title of first state to legalize sports betting.

It is important to note that no state has yet succeeded in legalizing sports betting. The process is slow, and there are many obstacles that need to be overcome before any state can actually offer this type of gambling. However, the momentum seems to be swinging in favor of legalization, and it is only a matter of time before one or more states officially announce that sports betting is now legal.

#  New Jersey Joins the List of States to Legalize Sports Betting

On Monday, June 11, 2018, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law legalizing sports betting in the state. New Jersey is now the fourth state in the US to legalize sports betting, following Delaware, Nevada, and New Mexico.

The new law allows casinos and racetracks in New Jersey to offer sports betting, with Murphy saying that it would "bring much-needed revenue to our state and enable us to reinvest in our neighborhoods."

Governor Murphy is expected to sign an additional bill into law soon that will allow online sports betting. This would make New Jersey the first US state to offer legal online sports betting.

Prior to this year, states were not allowed to legalize sports betting under the 1992 federal law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). However, in May of this year, the US Supreme Court struck down PASPA, opening the door for states to legalize sports betting.

Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize sports betting. In addition to Delaware, Nevada, and New Mexico, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,. Missouri Montana Nebraska New Hampshire New York North Carolina Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming have all legalized or are moving to legalize sports betting.

#  Nevada Leads the Way in Legalizing Sports Betting

Momentum is building for the legalization of sports betting across the United States following a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on Monday. The 5-4 decision struck down a 1992 law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, opening the door for other states to follow Nevada’s lead in legalizing and regulating the industry.

Nevada has been the only state where people could legally bet on individual sporting events since 1949, but that is likely to change in the coming months now that the federal ban has been lifted. Lawmakers in New Jersey, Connecticut, and West Virginia have already announced plans to legalize sports betting in their states, and more are likely to follow suit as lawmakers race to get legislation in place ahead of the start of the 2018 NFL season.

The American Gaming Association (AGA), which championed efforts to overturn the federal ban, estimates that $150 billion is wagered on sports each year, with only $4.8 billion wagered through legal channels. The vast majority of bets are placed illegally with offshore operators, resulting in billions of dollars in lost revenue for state and local governments.

Legalizing sports betting will not only provide a new stream of tax revenue for state and local governments, it will also create jobs and promote economic growth. The AGA estimates that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $26 billion in economic output over the next decade and create over 170,000 jobs nationwide.

For Nevada, which has been at the forefront of gaming innovation for decades, Monday’s ruling was a major victory. With a well-regulated sports betting industry already in place, Nevada is well positioned to become a national leader in this emerging market.

#  Delaware Becomes Second State to Legalize Sports Betting

On June 5, 2018, the Delaware Senate voted unanimously to legalize sports betting in the state. The bill now awaits the signature of Governor John Carney, who is expected to sign it into law.

With the passage of this bill, Delaware becomes the second state after New Jersey to legalize sports betting.

Under the new law, residents of Delaware will be able to place bets on professional and college sporting events at state-licensed casinos and racetracks.

The legislation also allows for mobile sports betting, which is likely to be popular given that Delaware is home to just three casinos and one horse track.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will bring new economic activity to the state, while opponents contend that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling.

Delaware is not the only state considering legalizing sports betting in light of last month's Supreme Court ruling striking down a federal ban on the practice.

Both New York and Pennsylvania are exploring legislation that would allow for sports betting within their borders.

#  California Poised to Join Other States in Legalizing Sports Betting

On Monday, the California Assembly voted to legalize sports betting in the state, sending the measure to Governor Jerry Brown for his signature. If signed into law, California would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last year that opened the door to such legalization.

Supporters of the measure argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state, which is facing a budget shortfall. They also argue that it would create jobs and boost the economy. Opponents, meanwhile, argue that the measure could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills.

Governor Brown has not yet indicated whether he will sign or veto the measure.
