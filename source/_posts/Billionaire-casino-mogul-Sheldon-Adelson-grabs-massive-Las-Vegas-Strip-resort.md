#  Billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson grabs massive Las Vegas Strip resort

Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has closed on the purchase of the largest hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, a $1.9 billion deal that gives him a dominant position on the world's most iconic gambling destination.

The Venetian and Palazzo resorts, which have a total of 7,109 rooms, were bought from casino operator MGM Resorts International, the companies said Monday.

The deal also includes ownership of the Sands Expo and Convention Center next to the Venetian and Palazzo.

The properties will be rebranded as The Adelson Resort in late 2013 after a $100 million renovation.

Adelson is chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., which operates casinos in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau. His purchase of The Venetian and Palazzo gives him control of more than 47 percent of the hotel rooms on the Las Vegas Strip.
MGM Resorts spokesman Gordon Absher said the company will continue to operate its 2,000-room Bellagio resort next to The Venetian and Palazzo.

"We're happy with it," Absher said of Adelson's purchase. "It just shows you that there is real interest in this market."
Las Vegas has been struggling since the recession began in late 2007, but tourism has been slowly recovering. In 2012, Las Vegas welcomed 37 million visitors, up from 34 million in 2011. room

#  Genting Group buys iconic Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut

Genting Group, a Malaysian casino and resort developer, has bought the iconic Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut from the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe for $2.3 billion. The purchase is the biggest in Genting's history, and it will see the company operating one of the largest casino resorts in the world.

Foxwoods has been a popular destination for gamblers since it opened in 1992, and its acquisition by Genting is likely to increase visitor numbers even further. The new owner has big plans to redevelop the property, including expanding the number of gaming tables and adding new restaurants, shops and hotel rooms.

The move comes as Genting seeks to expand its presence in North America. The company currently operates casinos in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Miami, but the Foxwoods acquisition gives it a foothold in the lucrative New England market. It is also another sign that gaming companies are looking to diversify away from their traditional markets as growth slows in places like Macau and Singapore.
